              The educational institutions have a great responsibility of creating holistic human beings, who have learned enough skills to earn, life ethics and social responsibility. B. S. Abdur Rahman crescent Institute of Science and technology being in the education arena for more than three decades has been successful in creating graduates with good technical skills, exhibiting great leadership skills and socially responsible citizens. The limitation was that the university was not able to extend this expertise to people around the globe and people who could not attend regular classes. The initiative of offering programmes through online and distance mode will help us overcome this barrier and spread our wings across the globe. Apart from degree programmes, certification programmes of international standards will help students from rural India learn technologies that are of great demand globally.

                An educationist for more than three decades, I believe that there is a big need for adapting to new technologies. The Online Distance education programme is an advantage to the learners both to upgrade their skill set and also to improve the qualification. This enhances the chances of better employment opportunities. This also gives a greater flexibility of learning whenever you can and wherever you are. The online and distance education courses at BSAUCIST are tailored to cater to people who are willing to upgrade their skills and seek better employment and also for people who are more willing to increase their academic qualification.

              The introduction of flexible learning technologies, the online education market is expected to grow multifold in the next few years. Adapting to the technological disruptions is very vital to all the educational institutions. The foresight of the institution in starting the online and distance education department is an exemplary achievement. The strength of the leading team and faculty are important in making all new initiatives a success. BSAUCIST has unarguably the best team and leaders which will make learning a great experience. The mentoring skills of our faculty would help every learner to have a unique experience while upgrading their qualifications and improving their knowledge.
